## Introduction

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling given by Udacity, to display a static version of the Memory Game project. After adding a JavaScript file and modifying the HTML and CSS files, this project was converted from a static project to an interactive one. 

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
